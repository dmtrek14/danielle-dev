# Welcome to my personal website - danielle-m.dev

I built this site in order to have a place to showcase my skills and projects. It uses Gatsby, MDX, CSS Grid, and Netlify. 

While I have opened up this project to show the code, I'd appreciate it if you don't simply clone my page and use it as your own. Be nice.

Thanks for taking a look!
