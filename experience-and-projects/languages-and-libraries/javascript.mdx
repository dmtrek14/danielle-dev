## How often I use
I probably use some variety of Javascript on a daily, or almost daily, basis.

## My skills with Javascript
I am most familiar with vanilla JS and jQuery, as I started using Javascript in the early 2000s and that was just what you used. These days, I've worked in a number
of additional frameworks and libraries. I am still getting used to ES6 and its syntax. 

## Frameworks and Libraries

### jQuery
I can write a good chunk of jQuery without needing to look up the syntax, but, for whatever reason, I always have to look up how to write an Ajax request even though
I have used Ajax for 7 years or so. A lot of the code throughout my workplace's website uses jQuery in one way or another. I can use it to add or remove classes,
submit forms, listen for various events, and loop through result sets. 

### Node.JS
I haven't written an entire web app in Node.js, but I have used it to create small helpers such as the bulk edit script listed under my projects and a helper that used
Puppeteer to scrape some data. I have also helped write a couple Electron apps (noted below).

### Gatsby/React
I started working with Gatsby and React a little more than a year ago and have since built a few sites using it, including this one. 

### Electron
We have built a couple of small-scale Electron applications at work now and I have a basic understanding of how to wire one up and get it running.
