## How often I use
Only when I have to troubleshoot existing Cold Fusion pages, which is usually every few months or so.

## My skills with Cold Fusion
I can set up a datasource with the Cold Fusion Admin, add new queries in a cfc file, modify queries in an existing cfc file or in a cfm page, output those queries and loop through results, and do some basic troubleshooting. I certainly would not call myself a Cold Fusion developer by any means, but I know enough to be dangerous.
