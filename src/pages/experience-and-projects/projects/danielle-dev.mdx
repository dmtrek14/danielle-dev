## About the project 
I've wanted to create a portfolio site for my dev work for a long time and have clearly finally pulled the trigger. I think resumes are great for what they are, but the goal of this site is to provide more information about me as a developer by giving more detailed information about my projects and experience than a resume has room for.

I used some of my favorite technologies to build the site, which helped me learn them even better.
