## About this project
The code itself is fairly self-explanatory here. I added a uid field to our Prismic model for the Research Division's "content" type and planned to slugify the title to use as the uid. I exported the Prismc data (which comes back as a zipped file of individual json files for each item in your Prismic repo) and saved it locally. I then wrote this helped to iterate through all of the json files, add a uid (from slugifying the title) and saving. I was able, then, to add the uid field in Prismic and import the data to effect a bulk update.
